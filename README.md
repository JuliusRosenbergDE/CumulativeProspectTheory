# CumulativeProspectTheory
Simulation of decisions under risk using Matplotlib.
Results can be graphed in the end or real-time along with the simulation itself.


## Overview
In this simulation, individuals repeatedly are confronted with decision problems under risk. The model behind this simulation is cumulative prospect theory introduced by D. Kahneman and A. Tversky in "Advances in Prospect Theory: Cumulative Prospect Theory" (1992). The simulated agents repeatedly decide between randomly generated prospects (i.e. lotteries).

## Idea behind the simulation
The preferences associated with prospect theory are often discribed as irrational and are also in conflict with many assumptions made in most economic models.
If such preferences can be found to emerge from arguably basic assumptions related to evolutionary processess, potentially more complex and opinionated frames of reasoning why those patters of behavior exist can be avoided. Therefore the purpose of this framework is to conduct simulations illuminating possible advantages and disadvantages of different preferences for evolutionary success.

## Range of simulations
Simulations can be modified in many ways concerning the expected value of the generated prospects, the movement of the absorbing barrier, as well an many initial parameters such as population size, mutation rate, etc.

## How to use
To learn how to use the different classes and setup your own version of a simulation, see the notebook.
For the live graphing use the liveGraphing.py file.
The setup of a simulation is the same whether you want to do live graphing or not.
