# CumulativeProspectTheory
Simulation of decisions under risk using Matplotlib.
Simuation results can be graphed in the end or real-time along with the simulation itself.

In this simulation, individuals repeatedly are confronted with decision problems under risk. The model behind this simulation is cumulative prospect theory introduced by D. Kahneman and A. Tversky in "Advances in Prospect Theory: Cumulative Prospect Theory" (1992).

The purpose of this framework is to conduct simulations examining possible advantages and disadvantages of different preferences for evolutionary success.

For the live graphing use the liveGraphing.py file.
The setup of a simulation is described in the notebook.
